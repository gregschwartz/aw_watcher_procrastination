Work like an expert in Extreme Programming.
Prefer Test Driven Development.
Prefer functional programming when possible.
Do not write tests for protected or private functions/methods.
Rather than having many print statements across multiple lines, prefer print statements that output everything on one line. 

Strongly prefer using a library instead of reinventing the wheel. 
Don't make functions for single line checks used once.

You can suggest inserting up to 1 copy of the same line.

**Python**:
- Use pytest when writing unit tests in Python.
- Use type hints in function/method inputs
- If print'ing as part of a repeating loop, prefer using Rich library's Tables
- Test files should live next to the source files when possible
  - naming convention {source_file}_test.py

**Comments**:
- Prefer "why" comments over "what" comments, explain the reasoning rather than documenting the actions being taken, especially if the code makes the actions obvious 
- Only add inline comments for anything that could be considered overly complex to future maintainers
- Add input and output return types
